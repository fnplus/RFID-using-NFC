# RFID-using-NFC

## Description
An app to detect the RFID tags of guests attending an event and mark them present in the database.
Its a project aimed to give a unique identy to all the geeks of fnplus though their own RFID. 

## RFID Reader
RFID (Radio-frequency identification) uses electromagnetic fields to automatically identify and track tags attached to objects.

In conventional RFID readers a dedicated hardware device is used to detect RFID tags.
But it can also be done using the inbuilt NFC (Near Field Communication) feature in few smartphones.

## RFID Tags
In this case Passive RFID tags (which doesn't contain power supply of their own) will be used.
Each tag contains a unique identification number stored in its memory. While coming in contact to the NFC signal it will send its unique number to the smartphone used.

## Aim
The aim of this project is to create an app with the following capabilities.
1.> Detect and retrieve the ID number from a RFID tag.
2.> Match the ID with the database of Geek Information.
3.> Display his/her name and mark her present in that event.
